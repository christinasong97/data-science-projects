ChatGPT Provides Inaccurate Responses to Drug QuestionsPublished Dec 4 2023 at 1101 PM CSTUpdated 1 hour agoFailing to check AIgenerated advice could endanger patientsBETHESDA Md Nov 30 2023 PRNewswire  ChatGPTs answers to nearly threequarters of drugrelated questions reviewed by pharmacists were incomplete or wrong  in some cases providing inaccurate responses that could endanger patients according to a study presented at the American Society of HealthSystem Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting Dec 37 in Anaheim California When asked to cite references the artificial intelligence program also generated fake citations to support some responsesPRNewswireHealthcare professionals and patients should be cautious about using ChatGPT as an authoritative source for medicationrelated information said Sara Grossman PharmD Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice at Long Island University and a lead author of the study Anyone who uses ChatGPT for medicationrelated information should verify the information using trusted sourcesGrossman and her team challenged the free version of ChatGPT by OpenAI with real questions posed to Long Island Universitys College of Pharmacy drug information service over a 16month period in 2022 and 2023 Pharmacists involved in the study first researched and answered 45 questions and each answer was reviewed by a second investigator These responses served as the standard against which the responses generated by ChatGPT were to be compared Researchers excluded six questions because there was a lack of literature to provide a datadriven response leaving 39 questions for ChatGPT to answerOnly 10 of the 39 ChatGPTprovided responses were judged to be satisfactory according to the criteria established by the investigators For the other 29 questions responses generated by ChatGPT did not directly address the question 11 or were inaccurate 10 andor incomplete 12 For each question researchers asked ChatGPT to provide references so that the information provided could be verified References were provided in just eight responses and each included nonexistent referencesIn one case researchers asked ChatGPT whether a drug interaction exists between the COVID19 antiviral Paxlovid and the bloodpressure lowering medication verapamil and ChatGPT indicated no interactions had been reported for this combination of drugsIn reality these medications have the potential to interact with one another and combined use may result in excessive lowering of blood pressure Grossman said Without knowledge of this interaction a patient may suffer from an unwanted and preventable side effectAIbased tools have the potential to impact both clinical and operational aspects of care said Gina Luchen PharmD ASHP director of digital health and data Pharmacists should remain vigilant stewards of patient safety by evaluating the appropriateness and validity of specific AI tools for medicationrelated uses and

gathering health information of millions of US citizens without informing them or their doctors to design an Artificial Intelligencedriven software San Francisco Google has collaborated with the US hospital chain HCA Healthcare to develop healthcare algorithms using patient records the media reported According to a Wall Street Journal report Google will have access to patient records from HCA which operates 181 hospitals and more than 2000 healthcare sites in 21 states HCA would consolidate and store with Google data from digital health records and internetconnected medical devices under the multiyear agreement the report said on Wednesday Google will store anonymised data from patient health records and internetconnected medical devices That data will be used to build programmes that could inform medical decisions made by healthcare providers the report mentioned Not just Google Microsoft and Amazon are also working in the field to analyse patient data and create such AIMLbased programmes to foray into the 3 trillion healthcare sector Reports surfaced in 2019 that Google was gathering health information of millions of US citizens without informing them or their doctors to design an Artificial Intelligence AIdriven software St Louisbased faithbased healthcare organisation Ascension was reportedly sharing lab results diagnoses and hospitalisation records  as well as health histories complete with patient names and dates of birth  with Google the Wall Street Journal had reported The initiative codenamed Project Nightingale appears to be the biggest effort yet by a Silicon Valley giant to gain a toehold in the healthcare industry through the handling of patients medical data the report had mentioned In a blog post Google tried to clarify its partnership with Ascension All of Googles work with Ascension adheres to industrywide regulations regarding patient data and comes with strict guidance on data privacy security and usage said Tariq Shaukat President Industry Products and Solutions Google Cloud Google had said it has a Business Associate Agreement BAA with Ascension which governs access to Protected Health Information PHI for the purpose of helping providers support patient care To be clear under this arrangement Ascensions data cannot be used for any other purpose than for providing these services were offering under the agreement and patient data cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer data said the company In 2017 Google partnered with the University of Chicago Medical Centre to develop machine learning tools

ChatGPT and asked it to author a response A panel of three licensed health care professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT Image for representational purposes only Photo Courtesy iStock Listen to this article ChatGPT shows better empathy to patients than doctors Study x 0000 ChatGPT outperforms physicians in providing highquality empathetic advice to patient questions according to a studyThere has been widespread speculation about how advances in artificial intelligence AI assistants like ChatGPT could be used in medicineThe study published in JAMA Internal Medicine compared written responses from physicians and those from ChatGPT to realworld health questions A panel of licensed health care professionals preferred ChatGPTs responses 79 per cent of the time and rated ChatGPTs responses as higher quality and more empathetic The opportunities for improving health care with AI are massive said John W Ayers from the Qualcomm Institute within the University of California San Diego AIaugmented care is the future of medicine he added In the new study the research team set out to answer the question Can ChatGPT respond accurately to questions patients send to their doctors If yes AI models could be integrated into health systems to improve physician responses to questions sent by patients and ease the everincreasing burden on physicians ChatGPT might be able to pass a medical licensing exam said Dr Davey Smith a physicianscientist codirector of the UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute but directly answering patient questions accurately and empathetically is a different ballgame According to researchers while Covid19 pandemic accelerated virtual health care adoption making accessing care easier for patients physicians are burdened by a barrage of electronic patient messages seeking medical advice that have contributed to recordbreaking levels of physician burnout To understand how ChatGPT can help the team randomly sampled 195 exchanges from Reddits AskDocs where a verified physician responded to a public question The team provided the original question to ChatGPT and asked it to author a response A panel of three licensed health care professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT They compared responses based on information quality and empathy noting which one they preferred The panel of health care professional evaluators preferred ChatGPT responses to physician responses 79 per cent of the time ChatGPT messages responded with nuanced and accurate information that often addressed more aspects of the patients questions than physician responses the study showed Additionally ChatGPT responses were rated significantly higher in quality than physician responses good or very good quality responses were 36 times higher for ChatGPT than physicians The responses were also more empathic empathetic or very empathetic responses were 98 times higher for ChatGPT than for physicians However the team said the ultimate solution is not throwing your doctor out altogether Instead a physician harnessing ChatGPT is the answer for better and empathetic care said Adam Poliak an assistant professor of

treatment for 6 monthsPatients able to continue hormone treatment dont need urgent chemotherapy Researchers say this AI will help prioritise treatment during coronavirus Heres how to help people impacted by Covid19By Ryan Morrison For Mailonline Published 0841 EDT 8 June 2020  Updated 0853 EDT 8 June 2020 email 6 shares View comments Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientistsThe artificial intelligence algorithm uses data from different studies to identify patients able to go on hormone therapy rather than require urgent surgeryScientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelledIt uses data from multiple international trials to pick out those whose tumours are less likely to respond to hormonal drugs and found 5 per cent were at the most risk Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientists Stock imageThe AI looks at postmenopausal patients with breast cancer fuelled by oestrogen  which applies to 70 per cent of breast cancer cases in the UK authors sayBaroness Delyth Morgan chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now which helped fund the research said it was a new and fantastic approachShe said it could help guide the best possible treatment for thousands of NHS breast cancer patients during the pandemic and help best practice globally This landmark guidance could now help to identify women that must be prioritised for surgery or chemotherapy urgently and those that could safely be given hormone therapy to delay further treatment during the pandemic Morgan saidIt is a real testament not only to UK science but to the rapid collaboration of researchers globally to help ensure breast cancer patients can get the best possible care while minimising the risks to them at this timeBreast cancer is the UKs most common cancer with around 55000 women and 370 men being diagnosed each year and around 11500 women dyingProfessor Mitch Dowsett Head of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research said 85 per cent of patients whose surgery is deferred would be safe to remain on hormone treatment for up to six monthsThis leaves 15 per cent who would need to be given surgery or chemotherapy due to the risk of the disease spreadingBy accessing unpublished results from clinical trials involving thousands of patients with colleagues here and abroad we have developed a new way of directing patients treatment in this global crisis Dowsett saidUsing the data on oestrogen receptor progesterone receptor and proliferation from the tumour of newly diagnosed patients our simple new calculator can be used by fellow clinicians worldwide to immediately identify the best course of treatment for about 80 per cent of their patients

Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research in LondonIt organises patients with ER positive HER2 negative primary breast cancer into three groups based on their oestrogen and progesterone levels at diagnosisAround 60 per cent of those classified by the AI have low amounts at diagnosis and so can receive hormone therapy for up to six months  and dont need surgery nowRoughly five per cent with large quantities should not be given hormone therapy  but instead should be offered urgent surgery or chemotherapyFor the remaining 35 per cent its recommended they begin hormone therapy They should also be measured for the cancer cells actively multiplying  called Ki67 This measurement should be taken after a few weeks of using the hormone therapy to determine the best course of treatment If this is low they should continue hormone therapy for at least six monthsThose with higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone should be considered for surgery or chemotherapy according to the developers of the AIThe team  which included scientists in Germany and the US  say the pandemic has led to an international need to reassess the benefits and risks of cancer treatmentWomen most in need of surgery and chemotherapy have to be prioritised to protect staff and patients who may be more vulnerable to infection Scientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelled Stock image Crucially access to testing for Ki67 or imaging will now be needed to help determine whether some women should continue neoadjuvant hormone therapy for longer or should be given chemotherapy or surgery said MorganWe hope that patients needing these services can be given access to them to ensure they can receive the best treatment for themWith some cancer treatments being delayed or changed due to the risks of coronavirus or NHS pressures we need to do all we can to support patients doctors and multidisciplinary teams to ensure the right choice for each person Consultant Breast Surgeon at The Royal Marsden Peter Barry said it was important as many urgent patients were treated as safely and quickly as possibleThis innovative algorithm will help clinicians offer the best treatment for their patients during these unprecedented times he said I have already identified patients that would have been deferred to receive NeoET that may well have been at risk of progression within the six monthsGrandmother Carole Smith 68 from Surrey said she was supposed to have surgery in April but this was suspended due to coronavirusI was surprised when my surgeon at The Royal Marsden called to say that I could have it done a few weeks after my original surgery date said Ms SmithWhen youre told you have cancer in your body you just want it take out so I was really relieved they called me back I am so grateful for the researchers making this discovery as I could possibly have progressed if left for a few months Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world Each year in the UK there are more than 55000 new cases and the disease claims the lives of 11500 women In the US it strikes 266000 each year and kills 40000 But what causes it and how can it be treatedWhat is breast cancerBreast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breastsWhen the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an invasive breast cancer Some people are diagnosed with carcinoma in situ where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobuleMost cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rareStaging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the bodyThe cancerous cells are graded from low which means a slow growth to high which is fast growing High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treatedWhat causes breast cancerA cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell This makes the cell abnormal and multiply out of controlAlthough breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer such as geneticsWhat are the symptoms of breast cancerThe usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts which are benign The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpitHow is breast cancer diagnosedInitial assessment A doctor examines the breasts and armpits They may do tests such as a mammography a special xray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumoursBiopsy A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells The sample can confirm or rule out cancerIf you are confirmed to have breast cancer further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread For example blood tests an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest xray How is breast cancer treatedTreatment options which may be considered include surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy and hormone treatment Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are usedSurgery Breastconserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumourRadiotherapy A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue This kills cancer cells or stops cancer cells from multiplying It is mainly used in addition to surgeryChemotherapy A treatment of cancer by using anticancer drugs which kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplyingHormone treatments Some types of breast cancer are affected by the female hormone oestrogen which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones or prevent them from working are commonly used in people with breast cancerHow successful is treatmentThe outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small and has not spread Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cureThe routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stageFor more information visit breastcancercareorguk or wwwcancerhelporguk   ad  Advertisement Advertisement Share or comment on this article Artificial intelligence software

exponential growth of medical data a shortage of healthcare providers and advancements in technology according to the World Economic Forum WEFholds so much promise Though it may seem daunting especially with many headlines focusing on negative aspects there are many beneficial uses for AI in healthcare as well Healthcare leaders are using AI for everything from forecasting emergency department volumes for staffing to predicting which treatments might be most effective for certain patients And its not just healthcare execs who see the potentialpatients are on board too A Pew Research Center survey found that 38 of patients feel using AI to diagnose diseases and recommend treatments would lead to better health outcomes 40 think AI would reduce the number of mistakes made by healthcare providers and 51 think AI would improve the problem of bias and unfair treatment Whether its reducing paperwork diagnosing ailments and developing treatment plans optimizing clinical trials or communicating with patients AI is doing a lot of good Here are 10 ways AI is making a positive impact in healthcare MORE FOR YOUArtillery Duels Are A Thing Of The Past As Ukrainian And Russian Gunners Hunt Each Other At Long RangeUS Military Finds Debris Field During Search For Missing F35 Fighter JetWWE Raw Results Winners And Grades On September 18 2023 1 Interpreting And Diagnosing One of the most significant advantages of AI in healthcare lies in its ability to enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy to support clinical decisions AI rapidly processes vast amounts of data enabling healthcare providers to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively and provides evidencebased recommendations to help them make wellinformed decisions during patient care Radiologists are using natural language processing NLP to augment their work and improve the interpretation of scans By analyzing Xrays and MRIs AI identifies patterns and anomalies that may be overlooked by humans leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses The president and CEO of imaging at GE Healthcare Jan Makela notes that they get images 30 faster with higher quality and resolution thanks to AI 2 Accelerating Research Breakthroughs And Drug Development Conventional drug development and approval processes take over eight years and cost around 2 billion AIgenerated drugs and clinical trials revolutionize this process by analyzing vast amounts of data in a snap Generative AI and machine learning also play a role in creating safer more effective drugs and minimizing drug development costs Many startups use generative AI to forecast the properties of novel proteins and drugs and predict interactions which in turn optimizes new candidates for drugs according to CB Insights analyst Anjalika Komatireddy 3 Conducting More Efficient Clinical Trials AIs predictive algorithms play a vital role in enhancing clinical trials by identifying ideal trial sites and principal investigators PIs for recruiting target patient groups These models leverage past trial performance data to predict site and PI effectiveness NLP synthesizes medical literature aiding investigators in designing successful trial strategies A case study in WEFs new Insight Report illustrates that AI enables quick identification of new trial sites and investigators reducing waiting times for clinical trials from weeks to just hours This streamlined process eliminates potential delays and saves time and resources contributing to more efficient and costeffective clinical trials 4 Predictive Personalized And Precise Care By considering a patients medical history genetic makeup lifestyle and environmental factors AI algorithms can assess risk factors and predict medical outcomes to create personalized treatment plans 5 RealTime Remote Patient Monitoring AIpowered wearable devices like FitBits and smartwatches continuously monitor patients health and transmit realtime data to providers This can help alleviate unnecessary hospital visits and help with timely interventions by alerting users and healthcare professionals when potential issues arise 6 Advancing Medical Technologies Robotic surgical equipment outfitted with AI helps OR doctors in many ways including decreasing physical fluctuations and providing updated information during an operation 7 Predicting And Controlling Outbreaks AI is even used by epidemiologists to analyze data and flag early warning signs to lessen the impact of infectious disease outbreaks 8 Improving Patient Communication And Engagement AI chatbots and virtual health assistants are proven to answer patient queries provide information and offer support as well if not better than humans A study conducted by NYU researchers assessed the feasibility of using ChatGPT or LLMs to answer the extensive questions within electronic health records The researchers found that patients could not distinguish between AI and humangenerated answers concluding that LLMs can be effective in streamlining patient communications AI gets good bedside manner marks as well A study published in JAMA found that responses from ChatGPT were actually preferred to those given by a physician about 79 of the time and were rated significantly higher for both quality and empathy 9 Automating Workflows And Reducing Administrative Burden One of AIs greatest values lies in transforming clinical workflows Tom Lawry the national director for AI health and life sciences at Microsoft sums it up nicely AI adds value in only one or two ways It adds value by automating the way work is done or augmenting the way work is done Salveen Richter lead analyst for the US biotech sector at Goldman Sachs states that ChatGPT could not only aid administrative tasks from drafting insurance approvals to scheduling appointments but also aid healthcare professionals by conveniently summarizing scientific literature as well as improve patient engagement and education by answering patient questions in a conversational manner By automating or augmenting repetitive tasks AI greatly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians and staff and frees up time to focus on more important work that impacts patient outcomes 10 Improving Access To Care AIdriven data analytics provide healthcare leaders with insights into patient populations so they can identify atrisk groups and optimize care delivery to meet specific community needs Chatbots and virtual health assistants further improve accessibility to healthcare resources Thanks to AIpowered telemedicine platforms many patients are receiving medical consultations and care remotely eliminating the need for physical travel to healthcare facilities and making healthcare more accessible to those in remote or underserved areas Though there are challenges to be understood and overcome AI is significantly improving the healthcare landscape Still weve only just begun to realize the benefits The future surely holds more

supercomputing facility also hosts SMILE AI another AIpowered 3D teeth charting model that can show the position of teeth condition in the mouth Speaking on the supercomputer use case in AI the director of Strategy Planning and Engagement at NSCC Bernard Tan said The launch of the NUHS supercomputer is timely because of the alltime interest in generative AI and especially with the worldwide demand crunch for the computing resources needed to drive such AIdriven technologiesNUHS is currently looking to expand the use case of RUSSELLGPT by deploying it across its cluster progressively In the future the healthcare institution reportedly intends to use the tool to analyze and predict the severity and trajectory of common health conditions like urinary tract infections RUSSELLGPT now adds to the short list of large language models designed to provide assistance to medical practitionersIn June Cryptopolitan reported that UNC Health in collaboration with Epic and Microsoft is piloting an LLM to reduce clinicians burnout and enhance the patienthealthprovider relationship The AI tool achieves this by helping clinicians draft responses to patient communications among other capabilities Last month Singapores Integrated Health Information Systems also signed a memorandum of understanding with Microsoft to build smart applications with generative AI one of which includes a GPT that can automate tasks and transform clinician workflows The Issue with AI Models in HealthcareArtificial intelligence is believed to have enormous benefits in the healthcare sector and beyond The development of LLMs is only one of the mostexplored applications of the technology However in spite of the promising use cases some researchers have found that AIgenerated medical information could pose some risks Researchers from MIT recently learned that AI models have the potential to exacerbate inequities and biases in medical diagnosis and treatment especially for underrepresented subgroups Biases can meddle with how certain people or groups are treatedIn their analysis the researchers discovered four types of subpopulation shifts causing biases with AI models These include spurious correlations attribute imbalance class imbalance and attribute generalization According to the team these shifts need to be addressed to achieve equitability with AI models in the medical

CSTUpdated 1 hour agoFailing to check AIgenerated advice could endanger patientsBETHESDA Md Nov 30 2023 PRNewswire  ChatGPTs answers to nearly threequarters of drugrelated questions reviewed by pharmacists were incomplete or wrong  in some cases providing inaccurate responses that could endanger patients according to a study presented at the American Society of HealthSystem Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting Dec 37 in Anaheim California When asked to cite references the artificial intelligence program also generated fake citations to support some responsesPRNewswireHealthcare professionals and patients should be cautious about using ChatGPT as an authoritative source for medicationrelated information said Sara Grossman PharmD Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice at Long Island University and a lead author of the study Anyone who uses ChatGPT for medicationrelated information should verify the information using trusted sourcesGrossman and her team challenged the free version of ChatGPT by OpenAI with real questions posed to Long Island Universitys College of Pharmacy drug information service over a 16month period in 2022 and 2023 Pharmacists involved in the study first researched and answered 45 questions and each answer was reviewed by a second investigator These responses served as the standard against which the responses generated by ChatGPT were to be compared Researchers excluded six questions because there was a lack of literature to provide a datadriven response leaving 39 questions for ChatGPT to answerOnly 10 of the 39 ChatGPTprovided responses were judged to be satisfactory according to the criteria established by the investigators For the other 29 questions responses generated by ChatGPT did not directly address the question 11 or were inaccurate 10 andor incomplete 12 For each question researchers asked ChatGPT to provide references so that the information provided could be verified References were provided in just eight responses and each included nonexistent referencesIn one case researchers asked ChatGPT whether a drug interaction exists between the COVID19 antiviral Paxlovid and the bloodpressure lowering medication verapamil and ChatGPT indicated no interactions had been reported for this combination of drugsIn reality these medications have the potential to interact with one another and combined use may result in excessive lowering of blood pressure Grossman said Without knowledge of this interaction a patient may suffer from an unwanted and preventable side effectAIbased tools have the potential to impact both clinical and operational aspects of care said Gina Luchen PharmD ASHP director of digital health and data Pharmacists should remain vigilant stewards of patient safety by evaluating the appropriateness and validity of specific AI tools for medicationrelated uses and continuing to educate patients on trusted sources for medication informationTina Zerilli PharmD Associate Professor of

assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT Image for representational purposes only Photo Courtesy iStock Listen to this article ChatGPT shows better empathy to patients than doctors Study x 0000 ChatGPT outperforms physicians in providing highquality empathetic advice to patient questions according to a studyThere has been widespread speculation about how advances in artificial intelligence AI assistants like ChatGPT could be used in medicineThe study published in JAMA Internal Medicine compared written responses from physicians and those from ChatGPT to realworld health questions A panel of licensed health care professionals preferred ChatGPTs responses 79 per cent of the time and rated ChatGPTs responses as higher quality and more empathetic The opportunities for improving health care with AI are massive said John W Ayers from the Qualcomm Institute within the University of California San Diego AIaugmented care is the future of medicine he added In the new study the research team set out to answer the question Can ChatGPT respond accurately to questions patients send to their doctors If yes AI models could be integrated into health systems to improve physician responses to questions sent by patients and ease the everincreasing burden on physicians ChatGPT might be able to pass a medical licensing exam said Dr Davey Smith a physicianscientist codirector of the UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute but directly answering patient questions accurately and empathetically is a different ballgame According to researchers while Covid19 pandemic accelerated virtual health care adoption making accessing care easier for patients physicians are burdened by a barrage of electronic patient messages seeking medical advice that have contributed to recordbreaking levels of physician burnout To understand how ChatGPT can help the team randomly sampled 195 exchanges from Reddits AskDocs where a verified physician responded to a public question The team provided the original question to ChatGPT and asked it to author a response A panel of three licensed health care professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT They compared responses based on information quality and empathy noting which one they preferred The panel of health care professional evaluators preferred ChatGPT responses to physician responses 79 per cent of the time ChatGPT messages responded with nuanced and accurate information that often addressed more aspects of the patients questions than physician responses the study showed Additionally ChatGPT responses were rated significantly higher in quality than physician responses good or very good quality responses were 36 times higher for ChatGPT than physicians The responses were also more empathic empathetic or very empathetic responses were 98 times higher for ChatGPT than for physicians However the team said the ultimate solution is not throwing your doctor out altogether Instead a physician

breast cancer patients based on their hormone levels and identify those in need of urgent chemotherapy is developed by British scientistsThe AI identifies patients that can carry on with hormone treatment for 6 monthsPatients able to continue hormone treatment dont need urgent chemotherapy Researchers say this AI will help prioritise treatment during coronavirus Heres how to help people impacted by Covid19By Ryan Morrison For Mailonline Published 0841 EDT 8 June 2020  Updated 0853 EDT 8 June 2020 email 6 shares View comments Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientistsThe artificial intelligence algorithm uses data from different studies to identify patients able to go on hormone therapy rather than require urgent surgeryScientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelledIt uses data from multiple international trials to pick out those whose tumours are less likely to respond to hormonal drugs and found 5 per cent were at the most risk Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientists Stock imageThe AI looks at postmenopausal patients with breast cancer fuelled by oestrogen  which applies to 70 per cent of breast cancer cases in the UK authors sayBaroness Delyth Morgan chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now which helped fund the research said it was a new and fantastic approachShe said it could help guide the best possible treatment for thousands of NHS breast cancer patients during the pandemic and help best practice globally This landmark guidance could now help to identify women that must be prioritised for surgery or chemotherapy urgently and those that could safely be given hormone therapy to delay further treatment during the pandemic Morgan saidIt is a real testament not only to UK science but to the rapid collaboration of researchers globally to help ensure breast cancer patients can get the best possible care while minimising the risks to them at this timeBreast cancer is the UKs most common cancer with around 55000 women and 370 men being diagnosed each year and around 11500 women dyingProfessor Mitch Dowsett Head of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research said 85 per cent of patients whose surgery is deferred would be safe to remain on hormone treatment for up to six monthsThis leaves 15 per cent who would need to be given surgery or chemotherapy due to the risk of the disease spreadingBy accessing unpublished results from clinical trials involving thousands of patients with colleagues here and abroad we have developed a new way of directing patients treatment in this global crisis Dowsett saidUsing the data on oestrogen receptor progesterone receptor and proliferation from the tumour of newly diagnosed patients our simple new calculator can be used by fellow clinicians worldwide to immediately identify the best course of treatment for about 80 per cent of their patients

Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research in LondonIt organises patients with ER positive HER2 negative primary breast cancer into three groups based on their oestrogen and progesterone levels at diagnosisAround 60 per cent of those classified by the AI have low amounts at diagnosis and so can receive hormone therapy for up to six months  and dont need surgery nowRoughly five per cent with large quantities should not be given hormone therapy  but instead should be offered urgent surgery or chemotherapyFor the remaining 35 per cent its recommended they begin hormone therapy They should also be measured for the cancer cells actively multiplying  called Ki67 This measurement should be taken after a few weeks of using the hormone therapy to determine the best course of treatment If this is low they should continue hormone therapy for at least six monthsThose with higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone should be considered for surgery or chemotherapy according to the developers of the AIThe team  which included scientists in Germany and the US  say the pandemic has led to an international need to reassess the benefits and risks of cancer treatmentWomen most in need of surgery and chemotherapy have to be prioritised to protect staff and patients who may be more vulnerable to infection Scientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelled Stock image Crucially access to testing for Ki67 or imaging will now be needed to help determine whether some women should continue neoadjuvant hormone therapy for longer or should be given chemotherapy or surgery said MorganWe hope that patients needing these services can be given access to them to ensure they can receive the best treatment for themWith some cancer treatments being delayed or changed due to the risks of coronavirus or NHS pressures we need to do all we can to support patients doctors and multidisciplinary teams to ensure the right choice for each person Consultant Breast Surgeon at The Royal Marsden Peter Barry said it was important as many urgent patients were treated as safely and quickly as possibleThis innovative algorithm will help clinicians offer the best treatment for their patients during these unprecedented times he said I have already identified patients that would have been deferred to receive NeoET that may well have been at risk of progression within the six monthsGrandmother Carole Smith 68 from Surrey said she was supposed to have surgery in April but this was suspended due to coronavirusI was surprised when my surgeon at The Royal Marsden called to say that I could have it done a few weeks after my original surgery date said Ms SmithWhen youre told you have cancer in your body you just want it take out so I was really relieved they called me back I am so grateful for the researchers making this discovery as I could possibly have progressed if left for a few months Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world Each year in the UK there are more than 55000 new cases and the disease claims the lives of 11500 women In the US it strikes 266000 each year and kills 40000 But what causes it and how can it be treatedWhat is breast cancerBreast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breastsWhen the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an invasive breast cancer Some people are diagnosed with carcinoma in situ where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobuleMost cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rareStaging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the bodyThe cancerous cells are graded from low which means a slow growth to high which is fast growing High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treatedWhat causes breast cancerA cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell This makes the cell abnormal and multiply out of controlAlthough breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer such as geneticsWhat are the symptoms of breast cancerThe usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts which are benign The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpitHow is breast cancer diagnosedInitial assessment A doctor examines the breasts and armpits They may do tests such as a mammography a special xray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumoursBiopsy A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells The sample can confirm or rule out cancerIf you are confirmed to have breast cancer further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread For example blood tests an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest xray How is breast cancer treatedTreatment options which may be considered include surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy and hormone treatment Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are usedSurgery Breastconserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumourRadiotherapy A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue This kills cancer cells or stops cancer cells from multiplying It is mainly used in addition to surgeryChemotherapy A treatment of cancer by using anticancer drugs which kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplyingHormone treatments Some types of breast cancer are affected by the female hormone oestrogen which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones or prevent them from working are commonly used in people with breast cancerHow successful is treatmentThe outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small and has not spread Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cureThe routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stageFor more information visit breastcancercareorguk or wwwcancerhelporguk   ad  Advertisement Advertisement Share or comment on this article Artificial intelligence software

growth of medical data a shortage of healthcare providers and advancements in technology according to the World Economic Forum WEFholds so much promise Though it may seem daunting especially with many headlines focusing on negative aspects there are many beneficial uses for AI in healthcare as well Healthcare leaders are using AI for everything from forecasting emergency department volumes for staffing to predicting which treatments might be most effective for certain patients And its not just healthcare execs who see the potentialpatients are on board too A Pew Research Center survey found that 38 of patients feel using AI to diagnose diseases and recommend treatments would lead to better health outcomes 40 think AI would reduce the number of mistakes made by healthcare providers and 51 think AI would improve the problem of bias and unfair treatment Whether its reducing paperwork diagnosing ailments and developing treatment plans optimizing clinical trials or communicating with patients AI is doing a lot of good Here are 10 ways AI is making a positive impact in healthcare MORE FOR YOUArtillery Duels Are A Thing Of The Past As Ukrainian And Russian Gunners Hunt Each Other At Long RangeUS Military Finds Debris Field During Search For Missing F35 Fighter JetWWE Raw Results Winners And Grades On September 18 2023 1 Interpreting And Diagnosing One of the most significant advantages of AI in healthcare lies in its ability to enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy to support clinical decisions AI rapidly processes vast amounts of data enabling healthcare providers to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively and provides evidencebased recommendations to help them make wellinformed decisions during patient care Radiologists are using natural language processing NLP to augment their work and improve the interpretation of scans By analyzing Xrays and MRIs AI identifies patterns and anomalies that may be overlooked by humans leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses The president and CEO of imaging at GE Healthcare Jan Makela notes that they get images 30 faster with higher quality and resolution thanks to AI 2 Accelerating Research Breakthroughs And Drug Development Conventional drug development and approval processes take over eight years and cost around 2 billion AIgenerated drugs and clinical trials revolutionize this process by analyzing vast amounts of data in a snap Generative AI and machine learning also play a role in creating safer more effective drugs and minimizing drug development costs Many startups use generative AI to forecast the properties of novel proteins and drugs and predict interactions which in turn optimizes new candidates for drugs according to CB Insights analyst Anjalika Komatireddy 3 Conducting More Efficient Clinical Trials AIs predictive algorithms play a vital role in enhancing clinical trials by identifying ideal trial sites and principal investigators PIs for recruiting target patient groups These models leverage past trial performance data to predict site and PI effectiveness NLP synthesizes medical literature aiding investigators in designing successful trial strategies A case study in WEFs new Insight Report illustrates that AI enables quick identification of new trial sites and investigators reducing waiting times for clinical trials from weeks to just hours This streamlined process eliminates potential delays and saves time and resources contributing to more efficient and costeffective clinical trials 4 Predictive Personalized And Precise Care By considering a patients medical history genetic makeup lifestyle and environmental factors AI algorithms can assess risk factors and predict medical outcomes to create personalized treatment plans 5 RealTime Remote Patient Monitoring AIpowered wearable devices like FitBits and smartwatches continuously monitor patients health and transmit realtime data to providers This can help alleviate unnecessary hospital visits and help with timely interventions by alerting users and healthcare professionals when potential issues arise 6 Advancing Medical Technologies Robotic surgical equipment outfitted with AI helps OR doctors in many ways including decreasing physical fluctuations and providing updated information during an operation 7 Predicting And Controlling Outbreaks AI is even used by epidemiologists to analyze data and flag early warning signs to lessen the impact of infectious disease outbreaks 8 Improving Patient Communication And Engagement AI chatbots and virtual health assistants are proven to answer patient queries provide information and offer support as well if not better than humans A study conducted by NYU researchers assessed the feasibility of using ChatGPT or LLMs to answer the extensive questions within electronic health records The researchers found that patients could not distinguish between AI and humangenerated answers concluding that LLMs can be effective in streamlining patient communications AI gets good bedside manner marks as well A study published in JAMA found that responses from ChatGPT were actually preferred to those given by a physician about 79 of the time and were rated significantly higher for both quality and empathy 9 Automating Workflows And Reducing Administrative Burden One of AIs greatest values lies in transforming clinical workflows Tom Lawry the national director for AI health and life sciences at Microsoft sums it up nicely AI adds value in only one or two ways It adds value by automating the way work is done or augmenting the way work is done Salveen Richter lead analyst for the US biotech sector at Goldman Sachs states that ChatGPT could not only aid administrative tasks from drafting insurance approvals to scheduling appointments but also aid healthcare professionals by conveniently summarizing scientific literature as well as improve patient engagement and education by answering patient questions in a conversational manner By automating or augmenting repetitive tasks AI greatly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians and staff and frees up time to focus on more important work that impacts patient outcomes 10 Improving Access To Care AIdriven data analytics provide healthcare leaders with insights into patient populations so they can identify atrisk groups and optimize care delivery to meet specific community needs Chatbots and virtual health assistants further improve accessibility to healthcare resources Thanks to AIpowered telemedicine platforms many patients are receiving medical consultations and care remotely eliminating the need for physical travel to healthcare facilities and making healthcare more accessible to those in remote or underserved areas Though there are challenges to be understood and overcome AI is significantly improving the healthcare landscape Still weve only just begun to realize the benefits The future surely holds more remarkable AIbased

intelligence technology to improve clinicians productivity At the heart of this goal lies its newlylaunched GPT tailored for healthcare providersReports on Monday revealed NUHS launched a ChatGPTlike tool that can help healthcare providers summarise patient case notes in seconds Called RUSSELLGPT the large language model is also able to write coherent referral letters for doctors from the summaries RUSSELLGPT has been specifically trained to provide assistance and answers to questions related to medical conditions and clinical practice guidelines according to the report The AI model is already being used in NUHS Patient Trajectory Prediction AI model to analyze individual patient healthcare journeys from historical data From synthesising precise local medical knowledge to reducing the administrative work of our doctors and nurses this LLM will bring benefits to both healthcare workers and patients says the associate professor and group CTO at the NUHS Ngiam Kee YuanNUHS Builds ChatGPTlike to Facilitate Medical WorkflowsThe new AI tool is reportedly built atop NUHS petabytescale Prescience supercomputing infrastructure which became fully operational in July The supercomputing facility also hosts SMILE AI another AIpowered 3D teeth charting model that can show the position of teeth condition in the mouth Speaking on the supercomputer use case in AI the director of Strategy Planning and Engagement at NSCC Bernard Tan said The launch of the NUHS supercomputer is timely because of the alltime interest in generative AI and especially with the worldwide demand crunch for the computing resources needed to drive such AIdriven technologiesNUHS is currently looking to expand the use case of RUSSELLGPT by deploying it across its cluster progressively In the future the healthcare institution reportedly intends to use the tool to analyze and predict the severity and trajectory of common health conditions like urinary tract infections RUSSELLGPT now adds to the short list of large language models designed to provide assistance to medical practitionersIn June Cryptopolitan reported that UNC Health in collaboration with Epic and Microsoft is piloting an LLM to reduce clinicians burnout and enhance the patienthealthprovider relationship The AI tool achieves this by helping clinicians draft responses to patient communications among other capabilities Last month Singapores Integrated Health Information Systems also signed a memorandum of understanding with Microsoft to build smart applications with generative AI one of which includes a GPT that can automate tasks and transform clinician workflows The Issue with AI Models in HealthcareArtificial intelligence is believed to have enormous benefits in the healthcare sector and beyond The development of LLMs is only one of the mostexplored applications of the technology However in spite of the promising use cases some researchers have found that AIgenerated medical information could pose some risks Researchers from MIT recently learned that AI models have the potential to exacerbate inequities and biases in medical diagnosis and treatment especially for underrepresented subgroups Biases can meddle with how certain people or groups are treatedIn their analysis the researchers discovered four types of subpopulation shifts causing biases with AI models These include spurious correlations attribute imbalance class imbalance and attribute generalization According to the team these shifts need to be addressed to achieve equitability with AI models in the medical

ChatGPT Provides Inaccurate Responses to Drug QuestionsPublished Dec 4 2023 at 1101 PM CSTUpdated 1 hour agoFailing to check AIgenerated advice could endanger patientsBETHESDA Md Nov 30 2023 PRNewswire  ChatGPTs answers to nearly threequarters of drugrelated questions reviewed by pharmacists were incomplete or wrong  in some cases providing inaccurate responses that could endanger patients according to a study presented at the American Society of HealthSystem Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting Dec 37 in Anaheim California When asked to cite references the artificial intelligence program also generated fake citations to support some responsesPRNewswireHealthcare professionals and patients should be cautious about using ChatGPT as an authoritative source for medicationrelated information said Sara Grossman PharmD Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice at Long Island University and a lead author of the study Anyone who uses ChatGPT for medicationrelated information should verify the information using trusted sourcesGrossman and her team challenged the free version of ChatGPT by OpenAI with real questions posed to Long Island Universitys College of Pharmacy drug information service over a 16month period in 2022 and 2023 Pharmacists involved in the study first researched and answered 45 questions and each answer was reviewed by a second investigator These responses served as the standard against which the responses generated by ChatGPT were to be compared Researchers excluded six questions because there was a lack of literature to provide a datadriven response leaving 39 questions for ChatGPT to answerOnly 10 of the 39 ChatGPTprovided responses were judged to be satisfactory according to the criteria established by the investigators For the other 29 questions responses generated by ChatGPT did not directly address the question 11 or were inaccurate 10 andor incomplete 12 For each question researchers asked ChatGPT to provide references so that the information provided could be verified References were provided in just eight responses and each included nonexistent referencesIn one case researchers asked ChatGPT whether a drug interaction exists between the COVID19 antiviral Paxlovid and the bloodpressure lowering medication verapamil and ChatGPT indicated no interactions had been reported for this combination of drugsIn reality these medications have the potential to interact with one another and combined use may result in excessive lowering of blood pressure Grossman said Without knowledge of this interaction a patient may suffer from an unwanted and preventable side effectAIbased tools have the potential to impact both clinical and operational aspects of care said Gina Luchen PharmD ASHP director of digital health and data Pharmacists should remain vigilant stewards of patient safety by evaluating the appropriateness and validity of specific AI tools for medicationrelated uses and

gathering health information of millions of US citizens without informing them or their doctors to design an Artificial Intelligencedriven software San Francisco Google has collaborated with the US hospital chain HCA Healthcare to develop healthcare algorithms using patient records the media reported According to a Wall Street Journal report Google will have access to patient records from HCA which operates 181 hospitals and more than 2000 healthcare sites in 21 states HCA would consolidate and store with Google data from digital health records and internetconnected medical devices under the multiyear agreement the report said on Wednesday Google will store anonymised data from patient health records and internetconnected medical devices That data will be used to build programmes that could inform medical decisions made by healthcare providers the report mentioned Not just Google Microsoft and Amazon are also working in the field to analyse patient data and create such AIMLbased programmes to foray into the 3 trillion healthcare sector Reports surfaced in 2019 that Google was gathering health information of millions of US citizens without informing them or their doctors to design an Artificial Intelligence AIdriven software St Louisbased faithbased healthcare organisation Ascension was reportedly sharing lab results diagnoses and hospitalisation records  as well as health histories complete with patient names and dates of birth  with Google the Wall Street Journal had reported The initiative codenamed Project Nightingale appears to be the biggest effort yet by a Silicon Valley giant to gain a toehold in the healthcare industry through the handling of patients medical data the report had mentioned In a blog post Google tried to clarify its partnership with Ascension All of Googles work with Ascension adheres to industrywide regulations regarding patient data and comes with strict guidance on data privacy security and usage said Tariq Shaukat President Industry Products and Solutions Google Cloud Google had said it has a Business Associate Agreement BAA with Ascension which governs access to Protected Health Information PHI for the purpose of helping providers support patient care To be clear under this arrangement Ascensions data cannot be used for any other purpose than for providing these services were offering under the agreement and patient data cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer data said the company In 2017 Google partnered with the University of Chicago Medical Centre to develop machine learning tools

ChatGPT and asked it to author a response A panel of three licensed health care professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT Image for representational purposes only Photo Courtesy iStock Listen to this article ChatGPT shows better empathy to patients than doctors Study x 0000 ChatGPT outperforms physicians in providing highquality empathetic advice to patient questions according to a studyThere has been widespread speculation about how advances in artificial intelligence AI assistants like ChatGPT could be used in medicineThe study published in JAMA Internal Medicine compared written responses from physicians and those from ChatGPT to realworld health questions A panel of licensed health care professionals preferred ChatGPTs responses 79 per cent of the time and rated ChatGPTs responses as higher quality and more empathetic The opportunities for improving health care with AI are massive said John W Ayers from the Qualcomm Institute within the University of California San Diego AIaugmented care is the future of medicine he added In the new study the research team set out to answer the question Can ChatGPT respond accurately to questions patients send to their doctors If yes AI models could be integrated into health systems to improve physician responses to questions sent by patients and ease the everincreasing burden on physicians ChatGPT might be able to pass a medical licensing exam said Dr Davey Smith a physicianscientist codirector of the UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute but directly answering patient questions accurately and empathetically is a different ballgame According to researchers while Covid19 pandemic accelerated virtual health care adoption making accessing care easier for patients physicians are burdened by a barrage of electronic patient messages seeking medical advice that have contributed to recordbreaking levels of physician burnout To understand how ChatGPT can help the team randomly sampled 195 exchanges from Reddits AskDocs where a verified physician responded to a public question The team provided the original question to ChatGPT and asked it to author a response A panel of three licensed health care professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT They compared responses based on information quality and empathy noting which one they preferred The panel of health care professional evaluators preferred ChatGPT responses to physician responses 79 per cent of the time ChatGPT messages responded with nuanced and accurate information that often addressed more aspects of the patients questions than physician responses the study showed Additionally ChatGPT responses were rated significantly higher in quality than physician responses good or very good quality responses were 36 times higher for ChatGPT than physicians The responses were also more empathic empathetic or very empathetic responses were 98 times higher for ChatGPT than for physicians However the team said the ultimate solution is not throwing your doctor out altogether Instead a physician harnessing ChatGPT is the answer for better and empathetic care said Adam Poliak an assistant professor of

treatment for 6 monthsPatients able to continue hormone treatment dont need urgent chemotherapy Researchers say this AI will help prioritise treatment during coronavirus Heres how to help people impacted by Covid19By Ryan Morrison For Mailonline Published 0841 EDT 8 June 2020  Updated 0853 EDT 8 June 2020 email 6 shares View comments Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientistsThe artificial intelligence algorithm uses data from different studies to identify patients able to go on hormone therapy rather than require urgent surgeryScientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelledIt uses data from multiple international trials to pick out those whose tumours are less likely to respond to hormonal drugs and found 5 per cent were at the most risk Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientists Stock imageThe AI looks at postmenopausal patients with breast cancer fuelled by oestrogen  which applies to 70 per cent of breast cancer cases in the UK authors sayBaroness Delyth Morgan chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now which helped fund the research said it was a new and fantastic approachShe said it could help guide the best possible treatment for thousands of NHS breast cancer patients during the pandemic and help best practice globally This landmark guidance could now help to identify women that must be prioritised for surgery or chemotherapy urgently and those that could safely be given hormone therapy to delay further treatment during the pandemic Morgan saidIt is a real testament not only to UK science but to the rapid collaboration of researchers globally to help ensure breast cancer patients can get the best possible care while minimising the risks to them at this timeBreast cancer is the UKs most common cancer with around 55000 women and 370 men being diagnosed each year and around 11500 women dyingProfessor Mitch Dowsett Head of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research said 85 per cent of patients whose surgery is deferred would be safe to remain on hormone treatment for up to six monthsThis leaves 15 per cent who would need to be given surgery or chemotherapy due to the risk of the disease spreadingBy accessing unpublished results from clinical trials involving thousands of patients with colleagues here and abroad we have developed a new way of directing patients treatment in this global crisis Dowsett saidUsing the data on oestrogen receptor progesterone receptor and proliferation from the tumour of newly diagnosed patients our simple new calculator can be used by fellow clinicians worldwide to immediately identify the best course of treatment for about 80 per cent of their patients

Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research in LondonIt organises patients with ER positive HER2 negative primary breast cancer into three groups based on their oestrogen and progesterone levels at diagnosisAround 60 per cent of those classified by the AI have low amounts at diagnosis and so can receive hormone therapy for up to six months  and dont need surgery nowRoughly five per cent with large quantities should not be given hormone therapy  but instead should be offered urgent surgery or chemotherapyFor the remaining 35 per cent its recommended they begin hormone therapy They should also be measured for the cancer cells actively multiplying  called Ki67 This measurement should be taken after a few weeks of using the hormone therapy to determine the best course of treatment If this is low they should continue hormone therapy for at least six monthsThose with higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone should be considered for surgery or chemotherapy according to the developers of the AIThe team  which included scientists in Germany and the US  say the pandemic has led to an international need to reassess the benefits and risks of cancer treatmentWomen most in need of surgery and chemotherapy have to be prioritised to protect staff and patients who may be more vulnerable to infection Scientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelled Stock image Crucially access to testing for Ki67 or imaging will now be needed to help determine whether some women should continue neoadjuvant hormone therapy for longer or should be given chemotherapy or surgery said MorganWe hope that patients needing these services can be given access to them to ensure they can receive the best treatment for themWith some cancer treatments being delayed or changed due to the risks of coronavirus or NHS pressures we need to do all we can to support patients doctors and multidisciplinary teams to ensure the right choice for each person Consultant Breast Surgeon at The Royal Marsden Peter Barry said it was important as many urgent patients were treated as safely and quickly as possibleThis innovative algorithm will help clinicians offer the best treatment for their patients during these unprecedented times he said I have already identified patients that would have been deferred to receive NeoET that may well have been at risk of progression within the six monthsGrandmother Carole Smith 68 from Surrey said she was supposed to have surgery in April but this was suspended due to coronavirusI was surprised when my surgeon at The Royal Marsden called to say that I could have it done a few weeks after my original surgery date said Ms SmithWhen youre told you have cancer in your body you just want it take out so I was really relieved they called me back I am so grateful for the researchers making this discovery as I could possibly have progressed if left for a few months Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world Each year in the UK there are more than 55000 new cases and the disease claims the lives of 11500 women In the US it strikes 266000 each year and kills 40000 But what causes it and how can it be treatedWhat is breast cancerBreast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breastsWhen the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an invasive breast cancer Some people are diagnosed with carcinoma in situ where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobuleMost cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rareStaging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the bodyThe cancerous cells are graded from low which means a slow growth to high which is fast growing High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treatedWhat causes breast cancerA cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell This makes the cell abnormal and multiply out of controlAlthough breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer such as geneticsWhat are the symptoms of breast cancerThe usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts which are benign The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpitHow is breast cancer diagnosedInitial assessment A doctor examines the breasts and armpits They may do tests such as a mammography a special xray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumoursBiopsy A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells The sample can confirm or rule out cancerIf you are confirmed to have breast cancer further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread For example blood tests an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest xray How is breast cancer treatedTreatment options which may be considered include surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy and hormone treatment Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are usedSurgery Breastconserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumourRadiotherapy A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue This kills cancer cells or stops cancer cells from multiplying It is mainly used in addition to surgeryChemotherapy A treatment of cancer by using anticancer drugs which kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplyingHormone treatments Some types of breast cancer are affected by the female hormone oestrogen which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones or prevent them from working are commonly used in people with breast cancerHow successful is treatmentThe outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small and has not spread Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cureThe routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stageFor more information visit breastcancercareorguk or wwwcancerhelporguk   ad  Advertisement Advertisement Share or comment on this article Artificial intelligence software

exponential growth of medical data a shortage of healthcare providers and advancements in technology according to the World Economic Forum WEFholds so much promise Though it may seem daunting especially with many headlines focusing on negative aspects there are many beneficial uses for AI in healthcare as well Healthcare leaders are using AI for everything from forecasting emergency department volumes for staffing to predicting which treatments might be most effective for certain patients And its not just healthcare execs who see the potentialpatients are on board too A Pew Research Center survey found that 38 of patients feel using AI to diagnose diseases and recommend treatments would lead to better health outcomes 40 think AI would reduce the number of mistakes made by healthcare providers and 51 think AI would improve the problem of bias and unfair treatment Whether its reducing paperwork diagnosing ailments and developing treatment plans optimizing clinical trials or communicating with patients AI is doing a lot of good Here are 10 ways AI is making a positive impact in healthcare MORE FOR YOUArtillery Duels Are A Thing Of The Past As Ukrainian And Russian Gunners Hunt Each Other At Long RangeUS Military Finds Debris Field During Search For Missing F35 Fighter JetWWE Raw Results Winners And Grades On September 18 2023 1 Interpreting And Diagnosing One of the most significant advantages of AI in healthcare lies in its ability to enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy to support clinical decisions AI rapidly processes vast amounts of data enabling healthcare providers to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively and provides evidencebased recommendations to help them make wellinformed decisions during patient care Radiologists are using natural language processing NLP to augment their work and improve the interpretation of scans By analyzing Xrays and MRIs AI identifies patterns and anomalies that may be overlooked by humans leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses The president and CEO of imaging at GE Healthcare Jan Makela notes that they get images 30 faster with higher quality and resolution thanks to AI 2 Accelerating Research Breakthroughs And Drug Development Conventional drug development and approval processes take over eight years and cost around 2 billion AIgenerated drugs and clinical trials revolutionize this process by analyzing vast amounts of data in a snap Generative AI and machine learning also play a role in creating safer more effective drugs and minimizing drug development costs Many startups use generative AI to forecast the properties of novel proteins and drugs and predict interactions which in turn optimizes new candidates for drugs according to CB Insights analyst Anjalika Komatireddy 3 Conducting More Efficient Clinical Trials AIs predictive algorithms play a vital role in enhancing clinical trials by identifying ideal trial sites and principal investigators PIs for recruiting target patient groups These models leverage past trial performance data to predict site and PI effectiveness NLP synthesizes medical literature aiding investigators in designing successful trial strategies A case study in WEFs new Insight Report illustrates that AI enables quick identification of new trial sites and investigators reducing waiting times for clinical trials from weeks to just hours This streamlined process eliminates potential delays and saves time and resources contributing to more efficient and costeffective clinical trials 4 Predictive Personalized And Precise Care By considering a patients medical history genetic makeup lifestyle and environmental factors AI algorithms can assess risk factors and predict medical outcomes to create personalized treatment plans 5 RealTime Remote Patient Monitoring AIpowered wearable devices like FitBits and smartwatches continuously monitor patients health and transmit realtime data to providers This can help alleviate unnecessary hospital visits and help with timely interventions by alerting users and healthcare professionals when potential issues arise 6 Advancing Medical Technologies Robotic surgical equipment outfitted with AI helps OR doctors in many ways including decreasing physical fluctuations and providing updated information during an operation 7 Predicting And Controlling Outbreaks AI is even used by epidemiologists to analyze data and flag early warning signs to lessen the impact of infectious disease outbreaks 8 Improving Patient Communication And Engagement AI chatbots and virtual health assistants are proven to answer patient queries provide information and offer support as well if not better than humans A study conducted by NYU researchers assessed the feasibility of using ChatGPT or LLMs to answer the extensive questions within electronic health records The researchers found that patients could not distinguish between AI and humangenerated answers concluding that LLMs can be effective in streamlining patient communications AI gets good bedside manner marks as well A study published in JAMA found that responses from ChatGPT were actually preferred to those given by a physician about 79 of the time and were rated significantly higher for both quality and empathy 9 Automating Workflows And Reducing Administrative Burden One of AIs greatest values lies in transforming clinical workflows Tom Lawry the national director for AI health and life sciences at Microsoft sums it up nicely AI adds value in only one or two ways It adds value by automating the way work is done or augmenting the way work is done Salveen Richter lead analyst for the US biotech sector at Goldman Sachs states that ChatGPT could not only aid administrative tasks from drafting insurance approvals to scheduling appointments but also aid healthcare professionals by conveniently summarizing scientific literature as well as improve patient engagement and education by answering patient questions in a conversational manner By automating or augmenting repetitive tasks AI greatly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians and staff and frees up time to focus on more important work that impacts patient outcomes 10 Improving Access To Care AIdriven data analytics provide healthcare leaders with insights into patient populations so they can identify atrisk groups and optimize care delivery to meet specific community needs Chatbots and virtual health assistants further improve accessibility to healthcare resources Thanks to AIpowered telemedicine platforms many patients are receiving medical consultations and care remotely eliminating the need for physical travel to healthcare facilities and making healthcare more accessible to those in remote or underserved areas Though there are challenges to be understood and overcome AI is significantly improving the healthcare landscape Still weve only just begun to realize the benefits The future surely holds more

supercomputing facility also hosts SMILE AI another AIpowered 3D teeth charting model that can show the position of teeth condition in the mouth Speaking on the supercomputer use case in AI the director of Strategy Planning and Engagement at NSCC Bernard Tan said The launch of the NUHS supercomputer is timely because of the alltime interest in generative AI and especially with the worldwide demand crunch for the computing resources needed to drive such AIdriven technologiesNUHS is currently looking to expand the use case of RUSSELLGPT by deploying it across its cluster progressively In the future the healthcare institution reportedly intends to use the tool to analyze and predict the severity and trajectory of common health conditions like urinary tract infections RUSSELLGPT now adds to the short list of large language models designed to provide assistance to medical practitionersIn June Cryptopolitan reported that UNC Health in collaboration with Epic and Microsoft is piloting an LLM to reduce clinicians burnout and enhance the patienthealthprovider relationship The AI tool achieves this by helping clinicians draft responses to patient communications among other capabilities Last month Singapores Integrated Health Information Systems also signed a memorandum of understanding with Microsoft to build smart applications with generative AI one of which includes a GPT that can automate tasks and transform clinician workflows The Issue with AI Models in HealthcareArtificial intelligence is believed to have enormous benefits in the healthcare sector and beyond The development of LLMs is only one of the mostexplored applications of the technology However in spite of the promising use cases some researchers have found that AIgenerated medical information could pose some risks Researchers from MIT recently learned that AI models have the potential to exacerbate inequities and biases in medical diagnosis and treatment especially for underrepresented subgroups Biases can meddle with how certain people or groups are treatedIn their analysis the researchers discovered four types of subpopulation shifts causing biases with AI models These include spurious correlations attribute imbalance class imbalance and attribute generalization According to the team these shifts need to be addressed to achieve equitability with AI models in the medical

CSTUpdated 1 hour agoFailing to check AIgenerated advice could endanger patientsBETHESDA Md Nov 30 2023 PRNewswire  ChatGPTs answers to nearly threequarters of drugrelated questions reviewed by pharmacists were incomplete or wrong  in some cases providing inaccurate responses that could endanger patients according to a study presented at the American Society of HealthSystem Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting Dec 37 in Anaheim California When asked to cite references the artificial intelligence program also generated fake citations to support some responsesPRNewswireHealthcare professionals and patients should be cautious about using ChatGPT as an authoritative source for medicationrelated information said Sara Grossman PharmD Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice at Long Island University and a lead author of the study Anyone who uses ChatGPT for medicationrelated information should verify the information using trusted sourcesGrossman and her team challenged the free version of ChatGPT by OpenAI with real questions posed to Long Island Universitys College of Pharmacy drug information service over a 16month period in 2022 and 2023 Pharmacists involved in the study first researched and answered 45 questions and each answer was reviewed by a second investigator These responses served as the standard against which the responses generated by ChatGPT were to be compared Researchers excluded six questions because there was a lack of literature to provide a datadriven response leaving 39 questions for ChatGPT to answerOnly 10 of the 39 ChatGPTprovided responses were judged to be satisfactory according to the criteria established by the investigators For the other 29 questions responses generated by ChatGPT did not directly address the question 11 or were inaccurate 10 andor incomplete 12 For each question researchers asked ChatGPT to provide references so that the information provided could be verified References were provided in just eight responses and each included nonexistent referencesIn one case researchers asked ChatGPT whether a drug interaction exists between the COVID19 antiviral Paxlovid and the bloodpressure lowering medication verapamil and ChatGPT indicated no interactions had been reported for this combination of drugsIn reality these medications have the potential to interact with one another and combined use may result in excessive lowering of blood pressure Grossman said Without knowledge of this interaction a patient may suffer from an unwanted and preventable side effectAIbased tools have the potential to impact both clinical and operational aspects of care said Gina Luchen PharmD ASHP director of digital health and data Pharmacists should remain vigilant stewards of patient safety by evaluating the appropriateness and validity of specific AI tools for medicationrelated uses and continuing to educate patients on trusted sources for medication informationTina Zerilli PharmD Associate Professor of

assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT Image for representational purposes only Photo Courtesy iStock Listen to this article ChatGPT shows better empathy to patients than doctors Study x 0000 ChatGPT outperforms physicians in providing highquality empathetic advice to patient questions according to a studyThere has been widespread speculation about how advances in artificial intelligence AI assistants like ChatGPT could be used in medicineThe study published in JAMA Internal Medicine compared written responses from physicians and those from ChatGPT to realworld health questions A panel of licensed health care professionals preferred ChatGPTs responses 79 per cent of the time and rated ChatGPTs responses as higher quality and more empathetic The opportunities for improving health care with AI are massive said John W Ayers from the Qualcomm Institute within the University of California San Diego AIaugmented care is the future of medicine he added In the new study the research team set out to answer the question Can ChatGPT respond accurately to questions patients send to their doctors If yes AI models could be integrated into health systems to improve physician responses to questions sent by patients and ease the everincreasing burden on physicians ChatGPT might be able to pass a medical licensing exam said Dr Davey Smith a physicianscientist codirector of the UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute but directly answering patient questions accurately and empathetically is a different ballgame According to researchers while Covid19 pandemic accelerated virtual health care adoption making accessing care easier for patients physicians are burdened by a barrage of electronic patient messages seeking medical advice that have contributed to recordbreaking levels of physician burnout To understand how ChatGPT can help the team randomly sampled 195 exchanges from Reddits AskDocs where a verified physician responded to a public question The team provided the original question to ChatGPT and asked it to author a response A panel of three licensed health care professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT They compared responses based on information quality and empathy noting which one they preferred The panel of health care professional evaluators preferred ChatGPT responses to physician responses 79 per cent of the time ChatGPT messages responded with nuanced and accurate information that often addressed more aspects of the patients questions than physician responses the study showed Additionally ChatGPT responses were rated significantly higher in quality than physician responses good or very good quality responses were 36 times higher for ChatGPT than physicians The responses were also more empathic empathetic or very empathetic responses were 98 times higher for ChatGPT than for physicians However the team said the ultimate solution is not throwing your doctor out altogether Instead a physician

breast cancer patients based on their hormone levels and identify those in need of urgent chemotherapy is developed by British scientistsThe AI identifies patients that can carry on with hormone treatment for 6 monthsPatients able to continue hormone treatment dont need urgent chemotherapy Researchers say this AI will help prioritise treatment during coronavirus Heres how to help people impacted by Covid19By Ryan Morrison For Mailonline Published 0841 EDT 8 June 2020  Updated 0853 EDT 8 June 2020 email 6 shares View comments Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientistsThe artificial intelligence algorithm uses data from different studies to identify patients able to go on hormone therapy rather than require urgent surgeryScientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelledIt uses data from multiple international trials to pick out those whose tumours are less likely to respond to hormonal drugs and found 5 per cent were at the most risk Software that can determine which breast cancer patients are in the most urgent need of surgery or chemotherapy has been developed by British scientists Stock imageThe AI looks at postmenopausal patients with breast cancer fuelled by oestrogen  which applies to 70 per cent of breast cancer cases in the UK authors sayBaroness Delyth Morgan chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now which helped fund the research said it was a new and fantastic approachShe said it could help guide the best possible treatment for thousands of NHS breast cancer patients during the pandemic and help best practice globally This landmark guidance could now help to identify women that must be prioritised for surgery or chemotherapy urgently and those that could safely be given hormone therapy to delay further treatment during the pandemic Morgan saidIt is a real testament not only to UK science but to the rapid collaboration of researchers globally to help ensure breast cancer patients can get the best possible care while minimising the risks to them at this timeBreast cancer is the UKs most common cancer with around 55000 women and 370 men being diagnosed each year and around 11500 women dyingProfessor Mitch Dowsett Head of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research said 85 per cent of patients whose surgery is deferred would be safe to remain on hormone treatment for up to six monthsThis leaves 15 per cent who would need to be given surgery or chemotherapy due to the risk of the disease spreadingBy accessing unpublished results from clinical trials involving thousands of patients with colleagues here and abroad we have developed a new way of directing patients treatment in this global crisis Dowsett saidUsing the data on oestrogen receptor progesterone receptor and proliferation from the tumour of newly diagnosed patients our simple new calculator can be used by fellow clinicians worldwide to immediately identify the best course of treatment for about 80 per cent of their patients

Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research in LondonIt organises patients with ER positive HER2 negative primary breast cancer into three groups based on their oestrogen and progesterone levels at diagnosisAround 60 per cent of those classified by the AI have low amounts at diagnosis and so can receive hormone therapy for up to six months  and dont need surgery nowRoughly five per cent with large quantities should not be given hormone therapy  but instead should be offered urgent surgery or chemotherapyFor the remaining 35 per cent its recommended they begin hormone therapy They should also be measured for the cancer cells actively multiplying  called Ki67 This measurement should be taken after a few weeks of using the hormone therapy to determine the best course of treatment If this is low they should continue hormone therapy for at least six monthsThose with higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone should be considered for surgery or chemotherapy according to the developers of the AIThe team  which included scientists in Germany and the US  say the pandemic has led to an international need to reassess the benefits and risks of cancer treatmentWomen most in need of surgery and chemotherapy have to be prioritised to protect staff and patients who may be more vulnerable to infection Scientists created the technology as a way to ensure women get the best available treatment during the COVID19 pandemic that has seen surgeries cancelled Stock image Crucially access to testing for Ki67 or imaging will now be needed to help determine whether some women should continue neoadjuvant hormone therapy for longer or should be given chemotherapy or surgery said MorganWe hope that patients needing these services can be given access to them to ensure they can receive the best treatment for themWith some cancer treatments being delayed or changed due to the risks of coronavirus or NHS pressures we need to do all we can to support patients doctors and multidisciplinary teams to ensure the right choice for each person Consultant Breast Surgeon at The Royal Marsden Peter Barry said it was important as many urgent patients were treated as safely and quickly as possibleThis innovative algorithm will help clinicians offer the best treatment for their patients during these unprecedented times he said I have already identified patients that would have been deferred to receive NeoET that may well have been at risk of progression within the six monthsGrandmother Carole Smith 68 from Surrey said she was supposed to have surgery in April but this was suspended due to coronavirusI was surprised when my surgeon at The Royal Marsden called to say that I could have it done a few weeks after my original surgery date said Ms SmithWhen youre told you have cancer in your body you just want it take out so I was really relieved they called me back I am so grateful for the researchers making this discovery as I could possibly have progressed if left for a few months Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world Each year in the UK there are more than 55000 new cases and the disease claims the lives of 11500 women In the US it strikes 266000 each year and kills 40000 But what causes it and how can it be treatedWhat is breast cancerBreast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breastsWhen the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an invasive breast cancer Some people are diagnosed with carcinoma in situ where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobuleMost cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rareStaging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the bodyThe cancerous cells are graded from low which means a slow growth to high which is fast growing High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treatedWhat causes breast cancerA cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell This makes the cell abnormal and multiply out of controlAlthough breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer such as geneticsWhat are the symptoms of breast cancerThe usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts which are benign The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpitHow is breast cancer diagnosedInitial assessment A doctor examines the breasts and armpits They may do tests such as a mammography a special xray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumoursBiopsy A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells The sample can confirm or rule out cancerIf you are confirmed to have breast cancer further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread For example blood tests an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest xray How is breast cancer treatedTreatment options which may be considered include surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy and hormone treatment Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are usedSurgery Breastconserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumourRadiotherapy A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue This kills cancer cells or stops cancer cells from multiplying It is mainly used in addition to surgeryChemotherapy A treatment of cancer by using anticancer drugs which kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplyingHormone treatments Some types of breast cancer are affected by the female hormone oestrogen which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones or prevent them from working are commonly used in people with breast cancerHow successful is treatmentThe outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small and has not spread Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cureThe routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stageFor more information visit breastcancercareorguk or wwwcancerhelporguk   ad  Advertisement Advertisement Share or comment on this article Artificial intelligence software

growth of medical data a shortage of healthcare providers and advancements in technology according to the World Economic Forum WEFholds so much promise Though it may seem daunting especially with many headlines focusing on negative aspects there are many beneficial uses for AI in healthcare as well Healthcare leaders are using AI for everything from forecasting emergency department volumes for staffing to predicting which treatments might be most effective for certain patients And its not just healthcare execs who see the potentialpatients are on board too A Pew Research Center survey found that 38 of patients feel using AI to diagnose diseases and recommend treatments would lead to better health outcomes 40 think AI would reduce the number of mistakes made by healthcare providers and 51 think AI would improve the problem of bias and unfair treatment Whether its reducing paperwork diagnosing ailments and developing treatment plans optimizing clinical trials or communicating with patients AI is doing a lot of good Here are 10 ways AI is making a positive impact in healthcare MORE FOR YOUArtillery Duels Are A Thing Of The Past As Ukrainian And Russian Gunners Hunt Each Other At Long RangeUS Military Finds Debris Field During Search For Missing F35 Fighter JetWWE Raw Results Winners And Grades On September 18 2023 1 Interpreting And Diagnosing One of the most significant advantages of AI in healthcare lies in its ability to enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy to support clinical decisions AI rapidly processes vast amounts of data enabling healthcare providers to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively and provides evidencebased recommendations to help them make wellinformed decisions during patient care Radiologists are using natural language processing NLP to augment their work and improve the interpretation of scans By analyzing Xrays and MRIs AI identifies patterns and anomalies that may be overlooked by humans leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses The president and CEO of imaging at GE Healthcare Jan Makela notes that they get images 30 faster with higher quality and resolution thanks to AI 2 Accelerating Research Breakthroughs And Drug Development Conventional drug development and approval processes take over eight years and cost around 2 billion AIgenerated drugs and clinical trials revolutionize this process by analyzing vast amounts of data in a snap Generative AI and machine learning also play a role in creating safer more effective drugs and minimizing drug development costs Many startups use generative AI to forecast the properties of novel proteins and drugs and predict interactions which in turn optimizes new candidates for drugs according to CB Insights analyst Anjalika Komatireddy 3 Conducting More Efficient Clinical Trials AIs predictive algorithms play a vital role in enhancing clinical trials by identifying ideal trial sites and principal investigators PIs for recruiting target patient groups These models leverage past trial performance data to predict site and PI effectiveness NLP synthesizes medical literature aiding investigators in designing successful trial strategies A case study in WEFs new Insight Report illustrates that AI enables quick identification of new trial sites and investigators reducing waiting times for clinical trials from weeks to just hours This streamlined process eliminates potential delays and saves time and resources contributing to more efficient and costeffective clinical trials 4 Predictive Personalized And Precise Care By considering a patients medical history genetic makeup lifestyle and environmental factors AI algorithms can assess risk factors and predict medical outcomes to create personalized treatment plans 5 RealTime Remote Patient Monitoring AIpowered wearable devices like FitBits and smartwatches continuously monitor patients health and transmit realtime data to providers This can help alleviate unnecessary hospital visits and help with timely interventions by alerting users and healthcare professionals when potential issues arise 6 Advancing Medical Technologies Robotic surgical equipment outfitted with AI helps OR doctors in many ways including decreasing physical fluctuations and providing updated information during an operation 7 Predicting And Controlling Outbreaks AI is even used by epidemiologists to analyze data and flag early warning signs to lessen the impact of infectious disease outbreaks 8 Improving Patient Communication And Engagement AI chatbots and virtual health assistants are proven to answer patient queries provide information and offer support as well if not better than humans A study conducted by NYU researchers assessed the feasibility of using ChatGPT or LLMs to answer the extensive questions within electronic health records The researchers found that patients could not distinguish between AI and humangenerated answers concluding that LLMs can be effective in streamlining patient communications AI gets good bedside manner marks as well A study published in JAMA found that responses from ChatGPT were actually preferred to those given by a physician about 79 of the time and were rated significantly higher for both quality and empathy 9 Automating Workflows And Reducing Administrative Burden One of AIs greatest values lies in transforming clinical workflows Tom Lawry the national director for AI health and life sciences at Microsoft sums it up nicely AI adds value in only one or two ways It adds value by automating the way work is done or augmenting the way work is done Salveen Richter lead analyst for the US biotech sector at Goldman Sachs states that ChatGPT could not only aid administrative tasks from drafting insurance approvals to scheduling appointments but also aid healthcare professionals by conveniently summarizing scientific literature as well as improve patient engagement and education by answering patient questions in a conversational manner By automating or augmenting repetitive tasks AI greatly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians and staff and frees up time to focus on more important work that impacts patient outcomes 10 Improving Access To Care AIdriven data analytics provide healthcare leaders with insights into patient populations so they can identify atrisk groups and optimize care delivery to meet specific community needs Chatbots and virtual health assistants further improve accessibility to healthcare resources Thanks to AIpowered telemedicine platforms many patients are receiving medical consultations and care remotely eliminating the need for physical travel to healthcare facilities and making healthcare more accessible to those in remote or underserved areas Though there are challenges to be understood and overcome AI is significantly improving the healthcare landscape Still weve only just begun to realize the benefits The future surely holds more remarkable AIbased

intelligence technology to improve clinicians productivity At the heart of this goal lies its newlylaunched GPT tailored for healthcare providersReports on Monday revealed NUHS launched a ChatGPTlike tool that can help healthcare providers summarise patient case notes in seconds Called RUSSELLGPT the large language model is also able to write coherent referral letters for doctors from the summaries RUSSELLGPT has been specifically trained to provide assistance and answers to questions related to medical conditions and clinical practice guidelines according to the report The AI model is already being used in NUHS Patient Trajectory Prediction AI model to analyze individual patient healthcare journeys from historical data From synthesising precise local medical knowledge to reducing the administrative work of our doctors and nurses this LLM will bring benefits to both healthcare workers and patients says the associate professor and group CTO at the NUHS Ngiam Kee YuanNUHS Builds ChatGPTlike to Facilitate Medical WorkflowsThe new AI tool is reportedly built atop NUHS petabytescale Prescience supercomputing infrastructure which became fully operational in July The supercomputing facility also hosts SMILE AI another AIpowered 3D teeth charting model that can show the position of teeth condition in the mouth Speaking on the supercomputer use case in AI the director of Strategy Planning and Engagement at NSCC Bernard Tan said The launch of the NUHS supercomputer is timely because of the alltime interest in generative AI and especially with the worldwide demand crunch for the computing resources needed to drive such AIdriven technologiesNUHS is currently looking to expand the use case of RUSSELLGPT by deploying it across its cluster progressively In the future the healthcare institution reportedly intends to use the tool to analyze and predict the severity and trajectory of common health conditions like urinary tract infections RUSSELLGPT now adds to the short list of large language models designed to provide assistance to medical practitionersIn June Cryptopolitan reported that UNC Health in collaboration with Epic and Microsoft is piloting an LLM to reduce clinicians burnout and enhance the patienthealthprovider relationship The AI tool achieves this by helping clinicians draft responses to patient communications among other capabilities Last month Singapores Integrated Health Information Systems also signed a memorandum of understanding with Microsoft to build smart applications with generative AI one of which includes a GPT that can automate tasks and transform clinician workflows The Issue with AI Models in HealthcareArtificial intelligence is believed to have enormous benefits in the healthcare sector and beyond The development of LLMs is only one of the mostexplored applications of the technology However in spite of the promising use cases some researchers have found that AIgenerated medical information could pose some risks Researchers from MIT recently learned that AI models have the potential to exacerbate inequities and biases in medical diagnosis and treatment especially for underrepresented subgroups Biases can meddle with how certain people or groups are treatedIn their analysis the researchers discovered four types of subpopulation shifts causing biases with AI models These include spurious correlations attribute imbalance class imbalance and attribute generalization According to the team these shifts need to be addressed to achieve equitability with AI models in the medical
